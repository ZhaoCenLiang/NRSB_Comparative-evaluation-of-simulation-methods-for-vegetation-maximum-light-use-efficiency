## Comparison of different seasonal simulation methods for LUE
Light use efficiency model is one of parametric models for estimating vegetation productivity based on remote sensing data. Its core parameter, maximum light use efficiency ( LUE<sub>max</sub> ), was considered as a fixed value for all vegetation types in the early stage (e.g., CASA). Moreover, it had become a  parameter varying with vegetation types since MODIS-LUE model, and recently it was considered to be dynamic with the phenology and physiological status of vegetation.
<br><br>
Although current vegetation productivity estimation models based on seasonally dynamic LUE<sub>max</sub> has showed a relatively higher accuracy, their studies were still limited in fewer vegetation types or smaller scales. Therefore, the applicability of different dynamic LUE<sub>max</sub> are not very clear in wider areas. 
<br><br>
We assessed three typical dynamic simulation methods of LUE<sub>max</sub> (which based on Chlorophyll Index, Leaf Area Index and Markov Chain Monte Carlo) by using the same dataset (FLUXNET 2015 dataset) and model structure (MODIS-LUE model structure).
